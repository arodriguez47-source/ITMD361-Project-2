    <h3>My Journey</h3>
    <p>I discovered computer science/programming in my junior year of High School as an elective. I didn't start off the most passionate about the field, however that changed after this first class. My first programming Language being Dr. Racket, I enjoyed the challenges that coding involved and the satisfaction of finally figuring it all out and making something work. From this spark of interest, I ended up taking an AP CS class the following year, and I started learning two new programming languages, Haskell and Java. I continued to work through problems presented by my teacher that involved a puzzle solving kind of mentality and I really enjoyed it. It was from then on that I was sure that I wanted to have a major in computer science. As I go through college, I have been exposed to many different factors in the computer science field, as it's not just programming and solving some problems given by a teacher, but how you implement them in real world situations. That is what I am trying to find here on Handshake, since I need experience in how to apply these skills in a job, and I'm still unsure how to. As of yet any job I've had is unrelated to computer science/programming, and I want to change that.</p>
